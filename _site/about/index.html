    <h1>The moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth's natural satellite, gracefully orbits our planet within
       the solar system. Bathed in reflected sunlight, the Moon completes 
       its elliptical journey around Earth approximately every 29.5 days,
        a phenomenon known as its lunar month. As it traverses this celestial path, 
        the Moon undergoes phases, transitioning from new to full and back again, casting 
        varying shades of light upon our nights. Its gravitational interaction with Earth 
        contributes to the ebb and flow of tides, showcasing the intricate interplay between 
        these two cosmic companions. While the Moon may seem serene and unchanging, its cyclical
         dance shapes terrestrial landscapes and has captivated human imagination throughout history.</p>
